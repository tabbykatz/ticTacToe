## Tired of Global Thermonuclear War? Play Tic Tac Toe!

# [Play the Game](https://tic-tac-toe-inky-ten.vercel.app/)

This project was heavily inspired by the [offical React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) but features functional components instead of classes alongside the requisite { useState } hook to manage board state. Because the board is a simple array alongside some integers to track turn number, I can save the history of a game and enable the user to move back and forth from turn to turn. 

When I work on this again, it will be to create a true game out of it by expanding board size and thus win cons like so:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
